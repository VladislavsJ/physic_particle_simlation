    //     int getCol() const { return m_gridNumberXY[1]; }

    // We'll mimic "private friend access" for the test:
    // In normal production code, you'd add a getter.
    // But here let's define a local lambda that extracts row/col from the
    // *center cell pointer* if we want. We have to be careful:
    // The center cell pointer is &grid.getCell(row, col).
    // There's no direct standard way to see which row/col that vector is from
    // except by pointer comparisons. We'll do the simpler approach:
    // just add a helper in the test fixture by searching for which row/col
    // matches c[CENTER].
